# Iris Dataset Classification – Logistic Regression vs KNN

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nikkibhoot-29/Iris-Classification-LogReg-vs-KNN/blob/main/iris_classification_logreg_vs_kn.ipynb)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete supervised machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset. The objective is to classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements and compare the performance of two classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The notebook includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and model comparison.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 observations across three species:

- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Features used:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

The dataset is balanced across classes.

## Workflow

1. Data Loading and Inspection  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
3. Handling Missing Values  
4. Feature Scaling  
5. Train-Test Split (Stratified)  
6. Model Training  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - KNN  
7. Model Evaluation  
8. Model Comparison  

---

## Results

Both models achieved strong classification performance. Logistic Regression slightly outperformed KNN, suggesting near-linear separability of the dataset.
